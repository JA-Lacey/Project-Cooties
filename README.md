## Teaching and Training Resources for Genomic Epidemiology and Pathogen Genomics using Fictitious Diseases 

This resouce was inspired by the Genomic Epidemilogical Handbook written by Allison Black and Gytis Dudas https://alliblk.github.io/genepi-book/index.html, which provides a fabulous background into the concepts and theory of genomic epemiology. Where this resource diverts is providing to practial hands on genomic-epidemiolgoy analysis.  

If you are interested in the history of epidemiology or if this is your very first exposure to genomic epidemiology I would recomend listeing to this epidsode of "This podcast will kill you" by the Erins https://thispodcastwillkillyou.com/2022/05/10/special-episode-on-the-origin-of-epidemiology/ and reading the book above. 

# Who is this resource for?

### Resource for teaching and training the concepts genomic epidemiology including

1. Epidemiological analysis and concepts
2. Genomics/Bioinformatics analysis and concepts
3. Outbreak detection and public health surveillance
4. Large scale data analysis

### This resource will be useful for:

- Public health microbiologists developing a genomic surveillance program.
- Bioinformaticians working in public health, and wanting to increase their familiarity with genomic epidemiology.
- Epidemiologists who want to integrate genetic information as well.
- Health officers or other policy makers who want to understand more about pathogen genomic data as a source of epidemiological information.
- Academics collaborating with with a public health institution who want to learn more about genomic epidemiology in applied public health settings (It might be more different than you think).
- Newly established public health systems (remote and under resourced settings) building or expanding their current capacity

### This resource will is NOT:

- Not provide an exhaustive description of all the questions that scientists can investigate with genomic epidemiology
- Not teach how to control or implement interventions against infectious disease
- We will not present every method for genomic epidemiological analysis, nor will we provide information on the entire suite of available analytic tools. You don't need a know how a hammer is made and the physics behind it for a hammer to be useful. Especially if you use it for its intended purpose. If you start using a hammer ad a screw driver then that's on you.
- Not discuss pathogen specific metrics or analysis that can be used in public health

### This will be achieved by teaching the concepts of genomic epidemiology via an entirely fictional pathogen (cooties virus)

- Use simulated epidemiological data and outbreak datasets including census data and medical data
- Use simulated genetic data (Viral genome, sequence reads, and SNP data)
